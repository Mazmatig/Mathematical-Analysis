\section{Euclidean Spaces}
\hspace*{1em}$\mathbb{R}^n$ is the $n$-field Cartesian product of $\mathbb{R}$, i.e., $\mathbb{R}^n = \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\times\cdots\mathbb{R} = \{(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)|x_i\in\mathbb{R}, i=1,2,\cdots,n\}$. Also, $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a linear space with respect to the addition and multiplication  of points by scalars (i.e., real numbers) which are defined for $x=(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$ and $y=(y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_n), c\in\mathbb{R}$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
    x+y & = (x_1+y_1, x_2+y_2, \cdots, x_n+y_n)\\
    cx & = (cx_1,cx_2,\cdots,cx_n)
\end{align*}
so that $x+y \in\mathbb{R}^n$ and $cx \in\mathbb{R}^n$. We also define the inner product (or scalar product) of $x$ and $y$
\begin{align*}
    (x,y) = x\cdot y = \sum^n_{i=1}x_iy_i
\end{align*}
and the norm of $x$ by
\begin{align*}
    \left\|x\right\| = (x\cdot x)^{\frac{1}{2}} = \left(\sum^n_{i=1}x_i^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{align*}
The structure now defined is called euclidean $n$-spaces. \\

\begin{theorem}
Suppose $x,y,z\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\alpha$ is real. Then \medskip \\
\hspace*{1em}\, (a)\,$\left\|x\right\|\geq 0$;\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (b)\,$\left\|x\right\| = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$;\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (c)\,$\left\|\alpha x\right\| = |\alpha|\left\|x\right\|$;\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (d)\,$\left\|x\cdot y\right\| \leq \left\|x\right\|  \left\|y\right\|$, this is called Cauchy-Schwarz inequality;\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (e)\,$\left\|x + y\right\| \leq \left\|x\right\| + \left\|y\right\|$, this is called Triangle inequality;\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (f)\,$\left\|x - z\right\| \leq \left\|x - y\right\| + \left\|y - z\right\|$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We only proof (d). If $x = (0,0,\cdots,0) = 0$, or $y = 0$, then it is obvious. If $x \neq 0$ and $y\neq 0$, then for $t\in\mathbb{R}$, we have 
\begin{align*}
    0 \leq \left\|x+ty\right\| & = (x+ty, x+ty) \\
    & = (x,x) + 2t (x,y) + t^2(y,y)
\end{align*}
And we know that $(x,x) + 2t (x,y) + t^2(y,y)$ is a quadratic function which is not negative. Hence, we have 
\begin{align*}
    & \Delta = \left(2(x,y)\right)^2 - 4 (x,x)(y,y) \leq 0 \\
    \Rightarrow & \left\|(x,y)\right\| \leq \left\|x\right\|  \left\|y\right\|
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\section{Metric Spaces}
\begin{definition}
A set $X$, whose elements we call points, is said to be a metric space if with any two points $x$ and $y$ of $X$ there is associated a real number $d(x,y): \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ called the distance from $x$ to $y$, which is defined as 
\begin{align*}
    d(x,y) = \left\|x - z\right\|
\end{align*}
which has the following properties\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (a)\,$d(x,y) > 0$ if $x\neq y$;\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (b)\,$d(x,y) = 0$ if $x = y$;\\ 
\hspace*{1em}\, (c)\,$d(x,y) = d(y,x)$;\\ 
\hspace*{1em}\, (d)\,$d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) + d(z,y)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $\{x_i\}^\infty_{i=1}$ be a sequence of points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $y\in\mathbb{R}^n$. We say that $\{x_i\}^\infty_{i=1}$ converges to $y$ if 
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{i\to\infty}\left\|x_i - y \right\| = 0
\end{align*}
Then we write $\lim_{i\to\infty}x_i = y$. Equivalently, $\lim_{i\to\infty}x_i = y$ if \begin{align*}
    \forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists N > 0, \forall n > N, d(x_n, y) < \varepsilon.
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
Let $x_i = (x_{1i}, x_{2i}, \cdots, x_{ni}) \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and $y = (y_{1}, y_{2}, \cdots, y_{n}) \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Then 
$$\lim_{i\to\infty}x_i = y$$ if and only if $$\lim_{i\to\infty}x_{ki} = y_k,k = 1,2,\cdots,n.$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We have 
\begin{align*}
    \left\|x_i - y\right\| & = \sqrt{(x_{1i}-y_1)^2 + \cdots + (x_{ni}-y_1)^2} \\
    & \geq \sqrt{(x_{ki}-y_k)^2} = |x_{ki} - y_k|
\end{align*}
Hence, $\left\|x_i - y\right\| \to 0 \Rightarrow |x_{ki} - y_k| \to 0$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, On the other hand, if $|x_{ki} - y_k|$ as $i\to\infty$ for $k = 1,2,\cdots, n$, then 
\begin{align*}
    \max_k |x_{ki} - y_k| \to 0 \quad \text{as}\quad i\to\infty
\end{align*}
and hence
\begin{align*}
    \left\|x_i - y\right\| & = \sqrt{(x_{1i}-y_1)^2 + \cdots + (x_{ni}-y_1)^2} \\
    & \leq \sqrt{n \max_k (x_{ki}-y_k)^2} \\
    & \leq \sqrt{n} \max_k |x_{ki} - y_k| \to 0.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and let $x_i\in X, i = 1,2,\cdots,$ and $x\in X$. We say that the sequence $\{x_n\}^\infty_{i=1}$ converges to $x$, saying
$\lim_{i\to\infty}x_i = x$ if $\lim_{i\to\infty}d(x_i, x) = 0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
Examples of metric spaces:\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (1)$(\mathbb{R}^n,\rho_1)$, where $\rho_1(x,y) = \max_i |x_i-y_i|$. And $B(0,1)$ in $(\mathbb{R}^2,\rho_1)$ is shown as above.\\
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{unit_ball_norm_1}
    \caption{$B(0,1)$ in $(\mathbb{R}^2,\rho_1)$}
    \label{fig:unit_ball_norm_1}
\end{figure}\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (2)$(\mathbb{R}^n,\rho_2)$, where $\rho_2(x,y) = \sum^n_{i=1} |x_i-y_i|$, this is called taxi metric or New York metric. And $B(0,1)$ in $(\mathbb{R}^2,\rho_2)$ is shown as bellow\\
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{unit_ball_norm_2}
    \caption{$B(0,1)$ in $(\mathbb{R}^2,\rho_2)$}
    \label{fig:unit_ball_norm_2}
\end{figure}\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (3)$(\mathbb{R}^n,\rho_3)$, where $\rho_3(x,y) = \left\|x-y\right\|$, this is called standard euclidean space.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (4)$(\mathbb{R}^n,\rho_4)$, where $\rho_4(x,y) = \left\|x-y\right\|^{1/2}$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (5)$(X,d)$, where $X$ is arbitrary set and 
\begin{align*}
    d(x,y) = \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
    & 1, \text{if} \quad x \neq y\\
    & 0, \text{if} \quad x = y
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{align*}
\hspace*{1em}\, This is called discrete metric space. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, (6)One can prove that every continuous function on $[0,1]$ is bounded. This fact implies that $(C,d)$, where $C([0,1]) = \{f:[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}, f \, \text{is continuous}\}$ with $d(f,g) = \left\|f-g\right\|_\infty = \sup \{|f(x) - g(x)|: x,y\in[0,1]\}$ is a metric space.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (7)Let $l^1 = \{x = \{x_n\}^\infty_{n=1}: \sum^\infty_{n=1}|x_n| < \infty\}$, i.e., $l^1$ is the space of all absolutely convergent sequences. For $x = \{x_n\}^\infty_{n=1}, y = \{y_n\}^\infty_{n=1} \in l^1$, we define 
\begin{align*}
    d(x,y) = \sum^\infty_{n=1} |x_n - y_n|
\end{align*}
We will prove that $(l^1,d)$ is a metric space.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, First we have $d(x,y) < \infty$ for $\forall x,y \in l^1$. And we have $|x_n-y_n|\leq |x_n|+|y_n|$, and hence
\begin{align*}
    d(x,y) = \sum^\infty_{n=1} |x_n - y_n| \leq \sum^\infty_{n=1} |x_n| + \sum^\infty_{n=1} |y_n| < \infty
\end{align*}
\hspace*{1em}\, Now we have $(1):d(x,y) \geq 0$ and $(2):d(x,y) = d(y,x)$, which is obvious. And $(3): d(x,y) = 0 \Leftrightarrow \forall x_n = y_n \Leftrightarrow x = y$. Finally, we have 
\begin{align*}
    |x_n - y_n| \leq |x_n - z_n| + |z_n - y_n|
\end{align*}
and hence 
\begin{align*}
    \sum^\infty_{n=1}|x_n - y_n| & \leq \sum^\infty_{n=1}|x_n - z_n| + \sum^\infty_{n=1}|z_n - y_n|\\
    \Rightarrow d(x,y) & \leq d(x,z) + d(z,y).
\end{align*}
\hspace*{1em}\, (8)Let $l^2 = \{x = \{x_n\}^\infty_{n=1}: \sum^\infty_{n=1}|x_n|^2 < \infty\}$. For $x = \{x_n\}^\infty_{n=1}, y = \{y_n\}^\infty_{n=1} \in l^1$, we define
\begin{align*}
    d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum^\infty_{n=1} (x_n - y_n)^2}
\end{align*}
Thus, $(l^2, d_x)$ is a metric space and this space is call Hilbert space.
\end{example} 

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
If $x_n\rightarrow x$ and $y_n\rightarrow y$ in a metric space, then $d(x_n, y_n) \rightarrow d(x,y)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The triangle inequality yields 
\begin{align*}
    d(x,y) \leq d(x,x_n) + d(x_n,y_n) + d(y_n,y)
\end{align*}
Then, we have $d(x,y) - d(x_n,y_n) \leq d(x,x_n) + d(y_n,y)$. Also, we have 
\begin{align*}
    d(x_n,y_n)\leq d(x_n,x) + d(x,y) + d(y,y_n)
\end{align*}
and then $d(x_n,y_n) - d(x,y)\leq d(x_n,x) + d(y,y_n)$. These two inequalities yield 
\begin{align*}
    |d(x,y) - d(x_n,y_n)| \leq d(x,x_n) + d(y_n,y) \to 0 
\end{align*}
and hence $$|d(x,y) - d(x_n,y_n)| \to 0 $$ which implies $d(x,y) \to d(x_n,y_n)$.
\end{proof}

\section{Elements of Topology}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. For $x\in X$ and $r>0$, we define 
\begin{align*}
    B(x,r) = \{y\in X: d(x,y) < r\}
\end{align*}
and call it the ball of radius $r$ centered at $x$. For example, if $(X,d)$ is a discrete metric space, then $B(x,1/2) = \{x\}$, $B(x,1) = \{x\}$ and $B(x,2) = X$.

\begin{definition}\label{openset}
We say that a set $U\subset X$ is open if $$\forall x\in X, \exists r > 0, B(x,r)\subset U.$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Definition in Rudin's Principle of Mathematical Analysis]Let $X$ be a metric space. \medskip \\
\hspace*{1em}\,(a)A neighborhood or a ball of $x$ is a set $N_r(x)$ consisting of all $y$ such that $d(x,y)<r$, \hspace*{2.3em}for some $r>0$. The number $r$ is called the radius of $N_r(x)$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\,(b)A point $x$ is a limit point of set $E$ if every neighborhood of $x$ contains a point $y\neq x$ \hspace*{2.3em}such that $y\in E$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (c)If $x\in E$ and $x$ is not a limit point of $E$, then $x$ is called an isolated point of $E$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (d)$E$ is closed if every limit point of $E$ is a point of $E$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (e)A point $x$ is an interior point of $E$ if there is a neighborhood(or ball) $N_r(x)$ of $x$ \hspace*{2.3em} such that $N_r(x)\in E$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (f)$E$ is open if every point of $E$ is an interior point of $E$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (g)The complement of $E$ (denoted by $E^c$) is the set of all points $x\in X$ such that $x\notin E$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (h)$E$ is perfect if $E$ is closed and if every point of $E$ is a limit point of $E$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (i)$E$ is bounded if there is a real number $M$ and a point $x\in X$ such that $d(x, y) < M$ \hspace*{2.3em} for all $y\in E$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (j)$E$ is dense in $X$ if every point of $X$ is a limit point of $E$, or a point of $E$(or both).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
Every ball $B(x,r)$ is open.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $B(x_0,r_0)$ be a ball. We will prove it is open. If $x\in B(x_0, y_0)$, then $d(x, x_0)<r_0$, then there exists a $r>0$, such that $$d(x,x_0)+r < r_0$$
We will now prove that $B(x,r)\subset B(x_0,r_0)$. Indeed, if $y\in B(x,r)$, then we have 
\begin{align*}
    d(x_0,y) & \leq d(x_0,x) + d(x,y) \\
    & \leq d(x_0,x) + r < r_0
\end{align*}
Since every point of $B(x,r)$ belongs to $B(x_0,r_0)$, we can conclude that $B(x,r)\subset B(x_0,r_0)$. According to Definition \ref{openset}, we proved that $B(x_0,r_0)$ is open.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, then\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (a)$\varnothing, X$ are open;\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (b)Intersection of a finite family $U_1, \cdots, U_n \subset X$ of open sets, $\bigcap^n_{i=1}U_i$ is open;\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (c)Union of an arbitrary family $U_i,i\in I$ of open sets, $\bigcup^n_{i\in I}U_i$ is open.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
(a)This is obvious.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (b)Suppose $U_1, \cdots, U_n \subset X$ are open. Let $x\in \bigcap^n_{i=1}U_i$, we need to show $B(x,r)\subset \bigcap^n_{i=1}U_i$ for some $r>0$. We have 
\begin{align*}
    x\in U_1 \Rightarrow B(x,r_1) & \subset U_1, \text{for some} \, r_1 > 0 \\
    x\in U_2 \Rightarrow B(x,r_2) & \subset U_2, \text{for some} \, r_2 > 0 \\
    & \vdots \\
    x\in U_n \Rightarrow B(x,r_n) & \subset U_n, \text{for some} \, r_n > 0
\end{align*}
\hspace*{1em}\, Hence, we can pick $r = \min\{r_1, r_2\cdots,r_n\}$, and it follows that $B(x,r) \subset \bigcap^n_{i=1}U_i$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (c)Let $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ be an arbitrary family of open sets and let $x\in \bigcup_{i\in I}U_i$. Then there exists a $i_0\in I$ such that $x\in U_{i_0}$, and hence $B(x,r) \subset U_{i_0} \subset \bigcup_{i\in I}U_i$ for some $r>0$. The proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\medskip

\begin{definition}
Given $A\subset X$, where $X$ is a metric space. The interior of the set $A$ is defines as 
$$\text{int}A = \{x\in A: \exists r > 0, B(x,r)\subset A\}$$
\end{definition}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
int$A$ is always open. It is the largest open set contained in $A$ in the sense that if $U\subset A$ is open, then $U \subset \text{int}A$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
$ $ \newline
\hspace*{1em}\, (a)If $U\subset A$, then for $\forall x\in U$, there exists $r>0$ such that $B(x,r)\subset U \subset \text{int}A$. This implies that $x\in \text{int}A$. Thus, $U\subset \text{int}A$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, (b)If $x\in \text{int}A$, then there exists $r>0$ such that $B(x,r)\subset A$. Since $B(x,r)$ is open and $B(x,r)\subset A$, we have $\text{int}A$ is open.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. We say that $A\subset X$ is closed if $X\setminus A$ is open.
\end{definition}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 2.23 in Rudin's book]
A set $A$ is open if and only if it complement is closed.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
First, suppose $A^c$ is closed. For $x\in A$, then $x\notin A^c$, and $x$ is not a limit point of $E^c$. Then there exists $r>0$ such that $B(x,r) \cap A^c = \varnothing$. Then, we have $B(x,r) \subset A$. Thus $x$ is an interior point of $A$ and it follows that $A$ is open.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, Next, suppose $A$ is open. Let $x$ be a limit point of $A^c$. Then every neighborhood of $x$ contains a point of $A^c$, so $x$ is not a interior point of $A$. Since $A$ is open, then $x\notin A$, which means $x\in A^c$. Since $x$ is a limit point of $A^c$, then $A^c$ is closed. The proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, then\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (a)$\varnothing, X$ are closed;\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (b)Intersection of an arbitrary family $U_i,i\in I$ of closed sets, $\bigcap^n_{i\in I}U_i$ is closed;\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (c)Union of a finite family $U_1, \cdots, U_n \subset X$ of closed sets, $\bigcup^n_{i=1}U_i$ is open.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
(a)$\varnothing$ is closed, since $X\setminus \varnothing = X$ is open. Also, $X$ is closed, since $X\setminus X = \varnothing$ is open.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (b)Suppose $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ is an arbitrary family of closed sets. Then the set $X\setminus U_i$ are open, and we have 
\begin{align*}
    \bigcup_{i\in I} (X\setminus U_i) = X \setminus \bigcap_{i\in I} U_i
\end{align*}
is open and hence $\bigcap_{i\in I} U_i$ is closed.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (c)Suppose the set $U_1, \cdots, U_n \subset X$ are closed. Then the sets $X\setminus U_i$ are open and hence
\begin{align*}
    \bigcap^n_{i=1} (X\setminus U_i) = X \setminus \bigcup^n_{i=1} U_i
\end{align*}
is open and it follows that $\bigcup^n_{i=1} U_i$ is closed.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Definition 2.26 in Rudin's book]
If $X$ is a metric space, if $E\subset X$, and if $E'$ denotes the set of all limit points(or accumulation points) of $E$ in $X$, the closure of $E$ is the set $\bar{E} = E \bigcup E'$.
\end{definition}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
In any metric space, the set $\bar{B}(x,r) = \{y\in X: d(x,y)\leq r\}$ is closed.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We can prove this theorem by proving that $X\setminus \bar{B}(x_0,r_0) = \{y\in X: d(x_0,y) > r\}$ is open.If $x\in X\setminus\bar{B}(x_0,r_0)$, then $d(x_0,x) > r$ and hence there exists $r > 0$ such that
\begin{align*}
    d(x_0,x) > r_0 + r
\end{align*}
And with triangle inequality, for $\forall y\in B(x,r)$, we have $d(x_0,y) \geq d(x,x_0) - d(x,y) > r_0$, since $d(x,y) < r$. Thus, we have $B(x,r)\subset X\setminus \bar{B}(x_0,r_0)$, which implies that $X\setminus \bar{B}(x_0,r_0)$ is open.
\end{proof}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
A set $A\subset U$ is closed if and only if the following implication is true: if a sequence $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty\in A$ such that $x_n\rightarrow x$, then $x\in A$, i.e., if for every convergent sequence of $A$, its limit belongs to $A$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
(a)Suppose $A$ is closed. We need to prove that if $x_n \in A$, then $x\in A$. Suppose by contradiction that $x_n\in A \rightarrow x$, but $x\notin A$. Then, $x\in X\setminus A$. Since $X\setminus A$ is open, there exists a $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $B(x,\varepsilon) \subset X\setminus A$. Then $d(x_n,x) > \varepsilon$ for all $n$ and thus $x_n$ does not converges to $x$, which is a contradiction. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, (b)Suppose that a set $A\subset X$ has the property that if $X_n \in A$ which converges to $x$, then $x\in A$. We need to prove that $A$ is closed. And we only need to prove that $X\setminus A$ is open. Then, we need to prove that, for $x\in X\setminus A$
\begin{align*}
    \exists \varepsilon > 0, B(x, \varepsilon)\subset X\setminus A
\end{align*}
\hspace*{1em}Suppose by contradiction that the above statement is not true, i.e., 
\begin{align*}
    \forall \varepsilon > 0, B(x,\varepsilon)\not\subset X\setminus A
\end{align*}
which means $B(x,\varepsilon)\bigcap A \neq \varnothing$. Then, taking $\varepsilon = 1/n$, $B(x,1/n)\bigcap A \neq \varnothing$. Then we take $x_n\in B(x,1/n)\bigcap A$. Then $x_n\in A$ and $d(x,x_n) < 1/n$, so $x_n\rightarrow x$. Since we assume $x\notin A$, and we get a contradiction. The proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. We say that $x\in X$ is an accumulation point(or cluster point, or limit point) of a set $A\subset X$ if there is a sequence $\{x_n\}^\infty_{n=0}$ such that $x_n\neq x$ and $x_n \rightarrow x$.
\end{definition}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
$x\in X$ is an accumulation point if and only if every open set containing $x$ contains an element of $A$ different than $x$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
(a)First, let $x \in U$ and $U$ is open. Then $B(x,\varepsilon)\subset U$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$. Let $x_n\in A$, $x_n \neq x$ and $x_n\to x$. Then there exists $n$ such that $x_n\in B(x,\varepsilon)\subset U$, where $x_n \neq x$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, (b)Second, for each ball $B(x, 1/n)$, there is a $x_n\in B(x,1/n)\bigcap A$ and $x_n \neq x$. Then it follows that $x_n\to x$. The proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
$A$ is closed if and only if all accumulation points of $A$ belong to $A$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
(a)First, suppose $A$ is closed, then $X\setminus A$ is open. So if $x\notin A$, then $B(x,\varepsilon)\subset X\setminus A$ for some $\varepsilon>0$. Then $B(x,\varepsilon)$ contains no point of $A$ and hence $x$ cannot be an accumulation point. Therefore, every accumulation point must belong to $A$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (b)Suppose all accumulation points of $A$ belong to $A$. We need to show that $A$ is closed, it suffices to prove that $X\setminus A$ is open. Let $x\in X\setminus A$, then $x$ is not an accumulation point of $A$, then there exists a open set $U$ such that $x\in U$ and $U$ contains no point of $A$. Hence, $U\subset X\setminus A$, and it follows $B(x,\varepsilon)\subset U\subset X\setminus A$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$. Thus, $X\setminus A$ is open. The proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 2.27 in Rudin's book]
The closure of $A$: $\text{cl}(A)$ is intersection of all closed sets that contain $A$. Therefore, $\text{cl}(A)$ is closed. Moreover, $\text{cl}(A)$ is the smallest closed set that contains $A$ in the sense that if $E$ is another closed set such that $A\subset E$, then $\text{cl}(A)\subset E$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
First, if $x\in X$ and $x\notin \text{cl}(A)$, then $x$ is neither a point of $A$ nor a accumulation point of $A$. Hence, for $x$ there exists a $B(x,\varepsilon) \bigcap A = \varnothing$, for some $\varepsilon > 0$. Then we have that $X\setminus \text{cl}(A)$ is open, which implies $\text{cl}(A)$ is closed. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, Second, If $E$ is closed and $A\subset E$, since $\text{cl}(A)$ is the intersection of all closed sets that contain $A$, and $E$ is in the family whose intersection we take, and hence $\text{cl}(A)\subset E$.
\end{proof}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
The closure of $A\subset X$ is $\text{cl}(A) = \{x\in X|\exists x_n\in A, n = 1,2,\cdots, x_n\to x\}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
We do not assume $x_n \neq x$ here.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
If $x\in A$, then $x_n = x$ satisfies that $x_n\to x$. If $x$ is an accumulation point of $A$, then there is a sequence $x_n\in A$ such that $x_n\to x$. Therefore, we have 
\begin{align*}
    \text{cl}(A) \subset \{x\in X|\exists x_n\in A,  x_n\to x\}
\end{align*}
On the other hand, if $x_n\in A$ and $x_n\to x$, then either all $x_n \neq x$ and $x$ is an accumulation point of $A$ or $x_n  = x$ for some $n$ and $x\in A$, which implies $$\{x\in X|\exists x_n\in A,  x_n\to x\}\subset \text{cl}(A)$$
The proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Boundary of a set}

\begin{definition}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, and $A\subset X$. Boundary of $A$ is defined as $\text{bd}(A) =  \text{cl}(A)\bigcap  \text{cl}(X\setminus A)$.
\end{definition}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
$x\in \text{bd}(A)$ if and only if there exists a sequence in $A$ and a sequence of $X\setminus A$ such that they both converge to $x$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
It is an obvious result following the definition above.
\end{proof}

Another theorem follows this theorem immediately.

\begin{theorem}
$x\in \text{bd}(A)$ if and only if $\forall \varepsilon > 0$, $B(x,\varepsilon)\bigcap A\neq\varnothing$ and $B(x,\varepsilon)\bigcap (X\setminus A)\neq\varnothing$.
\end{theorem}

\medskip

\subsection{Complete metric space}
\begin{definition}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. We say that a sequence $\{x_n\}^\infty_{n=1}$ of $X$ is a Cauchy sequence if $\forall\varepsilon > 0$, there $\exists N > 0$, such that $\forall n,m \geq N$, $d(x_n,x_m) < \varepsilon$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A sequence $\{x_n\}^\infty_{n=1}\in X$ is called bounded if $x_n\in B(x_0,R)$ for some ball $B(x_0,R)$ and $\forall n = 1,2,3,\cdots$.
\end{definition}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
$ $ \newline
\hspace*{1em}\, (a)Every convergent sequence in a metric space is a Cauchy sequence. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, (b)Every Cauchy sequence in a metric space is bounded.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (c)If a subsequence of a Cauchy sequence in a metric space is convergent, then the whole sequence is convergent to the same limit.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
(a) and (b) are obvious.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, (c)Suppose $\{x_n\}$ is a Cauchy sequence and $x_{n_k}\to x$. We need to prove that $x_n\to x$. For $\{x_{n_k}\}$, we have $\forall \varepsilon > 0$, there exists a $N_1$ such that for $\forall k \geq N_1$, $d(x_{n_k},x)<\varepsilon/2$. Also, since $\{x_n\}$ is a Cauchy sequence, then for $\forall \varepsilon > 0$, there exists a $N_2$ such that for $\forall n,m \geq N_1$, $d(x_n,x_m)<\varepsilon/2$. Take $N = \max\{N_1, N_2\}$, since $n_N \geq N$ , we have for $n \geq N$,
\begin{align*}
    d(x,x_n) \leq d(x_n, x_{n_N}) + d(x_{n_N}, x) < \varepsilon
\end{align*}
which means $x_n\to x$. The proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\medskip

\begin{definition}
We say that a metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence is convergent. For example, $\mathbb{R}$ is complete, but $\mathbb{Q}$ is not.
\end{definition}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
$\mathbb{R}^n$ is complete.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We have 
\begin{align*}
    & \{x_k\}_k = ((x_{k1},x_{k2},\cdots, x_{kn}))\,\text{is Cauchy sequence} \\
    \Leftrightarrow & \{x_{ki}\}_k, i = 1,2,\cdots, n \,\text{is Cauchy sequence} \\
    \Leftrightarrow & \{x_{ki}\}_k, i = 1,2,\cdots, n \,\text{is convergent} \\
    \Leftrightarrow & \{x_k\}_k\,\text{is convergent}
\end{align*}
The proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Let $\{x_n\}$ be a sequence in a metric space. We say that $x\in X$ is a cluster point of $\{x_n\}$ if $x$ is the limit of a sbusequence of $\{x_n\}$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
$ $
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $x\in X$ is an accumulation point of a set $A\subset X$ if there is a sequence $\{x_n\}^\infty_{n=0}\in A$ such that $x_n\neq x$ and $x_n \rightarrow x$.
  \item $x\in X$ is a limit point of set $A\subset X$ if every neighborhood of $x$ contains a point $y\neq x$ such that $y\in A$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
The set of cluster points is closed.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $a_k$ is a cluster point of $\{x_n\}$ and $a_k\to a$. We need to prove that $a$ is a cluster point of $x_n$. Each $a_k$ is a cluster point of a subsequence $x_{n_k}$, then in any neighborhood of $a$ there are infinitely many elements of $x_n$, and hence we can select a subsequence $x_{n_k}$ that converges to $a$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Let $A\subset X$ be a closed subspace of a complete metric space $(X,d)$, then $(A,d)$ is a complete metric space as well.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
If $\{x_n\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $A$, then it is a Cauchy sequence in $X$, so it converges to some point in $X$. Since $A$ is closed, then $x\in A$, which proves that $(A,d)$ is complete.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
In a metric space, $x_n\to x$ if and only if every subsequence of $x_n$ has a further subsequence that converges to $x$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
($\Rightarrow$) This is obvious result of convergence. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose that $\{x_n\}$ has the property above, but $x_n$ does not converge, that is $\exists \varepsilon > 0$, for $\forall N > 0$, there exists $n \geq N$ such that $d(x_n,x)\geq\varepsilon$. Thus we can pick a subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ of $\{x_n\}$ such that
$$d(x_{n_k},x)\geq\varepsilon$$
Clearly, we can know $\{x_{n_k}\}$ has no sequence converging to $x$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\medskip

\subsection{Compact spaces}
\begin{definition}
We say that a subset $A\subset X$ of a metric space is compact if every sequence in $A$ has a subsequence converging to a point in $A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Definition 2.31 \& 2.32 in Rudin's book]
$ $
\begin{itemize}
  \item By an open cover of a set $A$ in a metric space $X$ we mean a collection $\{G_\alpha\}$ of open subsets of $X$ such that $A\subset \bigcup_\alpha G_\alpha$.
  \item A subset $A$ of a metric space $X$ is said to be compact if every open vector of $A$ contains a finite subcover.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
If $A$ is compact, then $A$ is bounded and closed.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $A\subset X$ be compact. To prove that $A$ is closed we need to prove that 
\begin{align*}
    A\ni x_n\to x \Rightarrow x\in A
\end{align*}
Since $x_n\in A$ and $A$ is compact, then it has a subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ convergenting to a point $x$, then clearly $x\in A$. \\
\hspace*{3em}Now we prove that $A$ is bounded. Suppose $A$ is not bounded, we fixed $x_0\in X$ and find a sequence $\{x_n\}\in A$ such that $d(x_n, x_0) \geq n$. Then no subsequence of $\{x_n\}$ converges, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Heine-Borel Theorem]
$A\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is compact if and only if $A$ is bounded and closed.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
($\Rightarrow$) This is a result of proposition above. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, ($\Leftarrow$) We prove it for $n = 3$. Let $x_k\in A, k = 1,2,3,\cdots$. Since $A$ is bounded, we can know that all three elements of $x_k = (x_{1k},x_{2k},x_{3k})$ are bounded in $\mathbb{R}$. Then the sequence $\{x_{1k}\}_k$ is bounded, so Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, it has a convergent subsequence. Then $x_{1k_n}\to x_1$ and $x_1\in A$ since $A$ is closed. Similiarly, $\{x_{2k_n}\}$ also has a convergent subsequence $\{x_{2k_{n_m}}\}$ converging to $x_2\in A$, and $\{x_{3k_{n_m}}\}$ also has a convergent subsequence $\{x_{3k_{n_{m_l}}}\}$ converging to $x_3\in A$. Thus, we have 
\begin{align*}
    x_{k_{n_{m_l}}} = \left(x_{1k_{n_{m_l}}},x_{2k_{n_{m_l}}},x_{3k_{n_{m_l}}}\right)\to (x_1,x_2,x_3)\in A
\end{align*}
Then $A$ is compact.
\end{proof}

\medskip

\begin{definition}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and $A\subset U$ a subset. We say that a family of open sets $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ forms a open covering of $A$ if $A\subset  \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i$. Now, $\{U_{i_k}\}_{i_k\in I}, k = 1,2,\cdots,N$ forms a finite subcovering of $A$ if $A\subset \bigcup_{i_k=1}^N U_{i_k}$.
\end{definition}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}[Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem]
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and $A\subset X$ a subset. Then $(X,d)$ is compact if and only if every open covering of $A$ has a finite subcovering.
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
We denote balls in metric space $(X,d)$ and $(A,d)$ by $B^X(x,r)$ and $B^A(x,r)$ respectively. Clearly, $B^A(x,r) = B^X(x,r)\bigcap A$.
\end{remark}

Before we prove the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, we need to mention some other theorem and lemma. 

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 2.30 in Rudin's book]
$U\subset A$ is open in $(A,d)$ if and only if there is $W \subset X$ open in $(X,d)$ such that $U = W\bigcap A$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $W\subset X$ open in $X$ and $U = W\bigcap A$. Then for $\forall x\in U$, there exists a $r>0$ such that $B^X(x,r)\subset W$ and hence $B(x,r)^X\bigcap A\subset U\bigcap A = U$, where $B(x,r)^X\bigcap A$ is a ball in $A$. Then $U$ is open in $(A,d)$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $U\subset A$ is open in $(A,d)$. Then for $\forall x\in U$, there exists a $r>0$ such that $B^X(x,r)\bigcap A\subset U$, where $B^X(x,r)\bigcap A$ is a ball in $A$. Clearly, $U = \bigcup_{x\in X}B^X(x,r)\bigcap A$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, Now we set $W = \bigcup_{x\in X}B^X(x,r)$ and $W$ is open in $(X,d)$ and $$W\bigcup A = \bigcup_{x\in X}B^X(x,r)\bigcap A = U$$
The proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
$E\subset A$ is closed in $(A,d)$ is and only if there is a set $F\subset X$ closed in $(X,d)$ such that $E = F\bigcap A$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}\label{finitcover}
A metric space $X$ is compact if and only if every open covering of $X$ has a finite subcovering.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
($\Leftarrow$) Suppose that every open covering of $X$ has a finite subcovering. We need to prove that every sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $X$ has a convergent subsequence. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, By contradiction, we suppose that $\{x_n\}\in X$ does not has convergent subseqnece(Note that $\{x_n\}$ has infinitely many different values, otherwise we would have a constant, and thus convergent subsequence). Therefore we can select a subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ such that $x_{n_k} \neq x_{n_l}$ for $k\neq l$ and $\{x_{n_k}\}$ does not converge. Observe that the set $\{x_{n_1},x_{n_2},x_{n_3},\cdots\}$ is closed and the set has no accumulation point.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, In particular, every $x_{n_k}$ is not a accumulation point of the sequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$, and hence there is a $\varepsilon_k>0$ such that the ball $B(x_{n_k}, \varepsilon_k)$ contains no points of this sequence other than $x_{n_k}$, i.e., 
\begin{align*}
    x_{n_l}\notin B(x_{n_k}, \varepsilon_k), \text{if}\,l\neq k
\end{align*}
Clearly, $X\setminus \{x_{n_1},x_{n_2},x_{n_3},\cdots\}$ is open and hence $$X = \bigcup^\infty_{k=1}B(x_{n_k},\varepsilon_k) \cup \left(X\setminus \{x_{n_1},x_{n_2},x_{n_3},\cdots\}\right)$$ 
is an open covering of $X$. Thus, this covering has no finite subcovering.  \\
\hspace*{1em}\, ($\Rightarrow$) We need a lemma.
\begin{lemma}
Let $\bigcup_{i\in I}U_i$ be an open covering of a compact metric space of $X$ such that $X = \bigcup_{i\in I}U_i$. Then there is $r>0$(called Lebesgue number of the covering) such that $\forall x\in X$, $\exists i\in I$ such that $B(x,r)\subset U_i$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Prove by contradiction. Then we can find $x_n\in X$ such that $B(x_n,1/n)$ is not contained in any of the open set $U_i$. Since $X$ is compact, $\{x_n\}$ has a cinvergent subsequence $x_{n_k}\to x_0\in U_{i_0}$ for some $i_0\in I$. Then we have $B(x_0, \varepsilon)\subset U_{i_0}$ for some $\varepsilon>0$. Since $x_n\to x_0$, it is clear that $B(x_n,1/n)\subset B(x_0, \varepsilon)$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}
We need one definition and one more lemma.
\begin{definition}
A metric space $X$ is said totally bounded if $\forall \varepsilon>0$, there exists a finite covering of $X$ by balls of radius $\varepsilon$.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
If a metric space $X$ is compact, then $x$ is totally bounded.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}Prove by contradiction. Then there is a $\varepsilon>0$ such that no finite family of balls with radius $\varepsilon$ covers $X$. Let $x_1\in X$, then $B(x_1,\varepsilon)\neq X$. Then there exists $x_2\notin B(x_1,\varepsilon)$, and $B(x_1,\varepsilon)\cup B(x_2,\varepsilon)\neq X$. Then there exists $x_3\notin B(x_1,\varepsilon)\cup B(x_2,\varepsilon)$, and $B(x_1,\varepsilon)\cup B(x_2,\varepsilon)\cup\neq X$. We can continue this process and construct a sequence $\{x_1,x_2,x_3,\cdots\}$ in $X$ such that $d(x_k,x_l)\geq \varepsilon$ for $k\neq l$. Clearly, $\{x_n\}$ has no convergent subsequence, which is contradicted with compactness of $X$.
\end{proof}

\, Now we continue the proof of the implication ($\Rightarrow$) of theorem \ref{finitcover}. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose that $X$ is compact, i.e., every sequence in $x$ has a convergent subsequence. We need to prove that every open covering of $X$ has a finite subcovering. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, Let $X = \bigcup_{i\in I}U_i$ and let $r>0$ be a Lebesgue number of the covering. Since $X$ is totally bounded, $X$ has finite coverings by balls of radius $r$, i.e.,
\begin{align*}
    X = \bigcup^N_{i=1}B(x_i,r)
\end{align*}
By the definition of Lebesgue number, we have $B(x_i,r)\subset U_{k_i}$. Then,
\begin{align*}
    X = \bigcup^N_{i=1}B(x_i,r) \subset \bigcup^N_{i=1}U_{k_i}
\end{align*}
which gives a finite open subcovering of $X$. The proof of theorem \ref{finitcover} is complete. This also completes the proof is Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.
\end{proof}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
A metric space $X$ is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $X$ is compact. Then $X$ is totally bounded. To prove it is complete, let $\{x_n\}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $X$.  The by compactness, we can know some subsequence of $\{x_{n_k}\}$ is convergent, such that $x_{n_k}\to x_0$. Then $\{x_n\}$ also converges to $x_0$. Thus, $X$ is complete. \\
\hspace*{1em}\,($\Leftarrow$) Suppose that $X$ is complete and totally bounded. We need to prove that every sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $X$ has a convergent subsequence. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, Since $X$ is totally bounded , then it has a finite open covering of balls with radius $1$, i.e.,
\begin{align*}
    X = \bigcup^{N_1}_{i=1}B(x_i^{(1)},1)
\end{align*}
Hence, infinitely many elements of sequence $\{x_n\}$ belong to at least one of the balls, saying $B(x_{i_1}^{(1)},1)$. This ball has a finite open covering by balls with radius of $\frac{1}{2}$, i.e.,
\begin{align*}
    B(x_{i_1}^{(1)},1) = \bigcup^{N_2}_{i=1}B\left(x_i^{(2)},\frac{1}{2}\right)\cap B(x_{i_1}^{(1)},1) 
\end{align*}
Still, infinitely many elements of the sequence belong to at least one of the set on the right hand side, saying $B\left(x_{i_2}^{(2)},\frac{1}{2}\right)\cap B(x_{i_1}^{(1)},1)$. And this set has a finite open covering by balls of radius of $\frac{1}{3}$, i.e.,
\begin{align*}
    B\left(x_{i_2}^{(2)},\frac{1}{2}\right)\cap B(x_{i_1}^{(1)},1) = \bigcup^{N_3}_{i=1} B\left(x_{i}^{(3)},\frac{1}{3}\right)\cap B\left(x_{i_2}^{(2)},\frac{1}{2}\right)\cap B(x_{i_1}^{(1)},1)
\end{align*}
Still, infinitely many elements of the sequence belong to at least one of the set on the right hand side, and we continue this process and pick a subsequence from the given sequence $\{x_n\}$ such that 
\begin{align*}
    x_{n_1} &\in B(x_{i_1}^{(1)},1) \\
    x_{n_2} &\in B\left(x_{i_2}^{(2)},\frac{1}{2}\right)\cap B(x_{i_1}^{(1)},1) \\
    x_{n_3} &\in B\left(x_{i_3}^{(3)},\frac{1}{3}\right)\cap B\left(x_{i_2}^{(2)},\frac{1}{2}\right)\cap B(x_{i_1}^{(1)},1)\\
    & \vdots
\end{align*}
\hspace*{1em}\, Therefore, for $k,;l\geq N$, we have $x_{n_k},x_{n_l}\in B\left(x_{i_N}^{(2)},\frac{1}{N}\right)$ and hence
\begin{align*}
    d(x_{n_k},x_{n_l}) < \frac{2}{N}
\end{align*}
\hspace*{1em}\,Thus the sequence is Cauchy sequence and therefore convergent, it follows that $X$ is complete.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
If $F_k\subset X$ are nonempty compact sets such that $F_1\supset F_2\supset F_3\supset\cdots$, then $\bigcap^\infty_{k=1}F_k\neq\varnothing$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $x_k\in F_k$ for $k = 1,2,3,\cdots$. Then $X_n\in F_k$ for all $n\geq k$. In particular, $x_n\in F_1$ for all $n$. Hence $x_n$ has a convergent subsequence  in $F_1$($F_1$ is compact), saying $x_{n_l}\to x_0\in F_1$. Now, we have $x_{n_l}\in F_k$ for all $n_l \geq k$, and hence the limit $x_0$ of $\{x_{n_l}\}$ must belong to every $F_k$, i.e., $x_0\in \bigcup^\infty_{k=1}F_k$ which proves the intersection is not empty.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
The claim is not true if $F_k$ are open or closed but unbounded, for example
\begin{align*}
    \bigcap^\infty_{k=1}\left(0,\frac{1}{k}\right) &= \varnothing \\
    \bigcap^\infty_{k=1}\left[k,\infty\right) &= \varnothing
\end{align*}
\end{remark}

\subsection{Cantor set}
\begin{definition}
By the segment $(a,b)$ we mean the set of all real numbers $x$ such that $a<x<b$. By the interval $[a,b]$ we mean the set of all real numbers $x$ such that $a\leq x\leq b$.
\end{definition}
The set which we are now constructing shows that there exists perfect set in $\mathbb{R}^1$ which contain no segment. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, (1)Let $E_0$ be the interval $[0,1]$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, (2)Remove the segment $\left(\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3}\right)$, and let $E_1$ be the union of the interval of $$\left[0,\frac{1}{3}\right],\left[\frac{1}{3},1\right].$$ \\
\hspace*{1em}\, (3)Remove the middle thirds of these two intervals and let $E_2$ be the union of $$\left[0,\frac{1}{9}\right],\left[\frac{2}{9},\frac{1}{3}\right],\left[\frac{6}{9},\frac{7}{9}\right],\left[\frac{8}{9},1\right].$$ \\
\hspace*{1em}\, (4)Continue this way and we can get a sequence of compact sets $E_n$, such that $E_1\supset E_2\supset E_3\supset\cdots$ and $E_n$ is the union of $2^n$ intervals with length $3^{-n}$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, We show the Cantor set in seven iterations as below:

\hspace*{1em}\, The set
\begin{align*}
    P = \bigcap^\infty_{n=1}E_1
\end{align*}
is called the Cantor set. $P$ is clearly compact and $P$ is not empty. And one can prove that $P$ is uncountable.

\begin{exercise}
Prove that the space $X$ is connected if and only if the only subsets of $X$ that are open and closed at the same time are $\varnothing$ and $X$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $X$ is connected. We want to show that if $E\subset X$ is open and closed at the same time, then $E = X$ or $E = \varnothing$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, Suppose by contraction that there exists a $E\subset X$ such that $E\neq X$, $E\neq\varnothing$ and $E$ is open and closed at the same time. Then $U = E$, $V = X\setminus E$ are both open. And we have $X \subset U\cup V$, $X\cap U \neq \varnothing$, $X\cap V \neq \varnothing$, $X\cap U = V \neq \varnothing$ and $X\cap (U\cap V) = X\cap E\cap (X\setminus E) = \varnothing$. Thus, $X$ is disconnected, which is a contradiction. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose that the only subsets of $X$ that are open and closed at the same time are $\varnothing$ and $X$. We need to show that $X$ is connected. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, By contradiction that $X$ is not connected. Then, there exists two open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $X = U\cup V$, $X\cap U \neq \varnothing$, $X\cap V \neq \varnothing$, $X\cap U = V \neq \varnothing$. Then $U\neq \varnothing$ and it is also closed since $X\setminus U = V$ is open, then this is a contradiction with the fact that $X$ and $\varnothing$ are only sets that are open and closed at the same time.
\end{proof}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
If $A\subset X$ is path connected, then $A$ is connected.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Prove by contradiction and suppose $A$ is path connected but not connected. Then $A \subset U\cup V$, $A\cap U\neq\varnothing$, $A\cap V\neq\varnothing$, and $A\cap (U\cap V)=\varnothing$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, Let $x\in A\cap U$, $y\in A\cap V$, and let $\varphi:[a,b]\rightarrow A$ be a continuous path such that $\varphi(a) = x, \varphi(b) = y$. Define $c = \sup\{t\in[a,b]|\, \varphi\left([a,t]\right)\subset A\cap U\}$. If $\varphi(c)\in A\cap U$, then $c\neq b$\,(otherwise it would implies $\varphi(c) = \varphi(b) = y \in A\cap U$, which is impossible). \\
\hspace*{1em}\, Since $\varphi(c)\in A\cap U$ and $c<b$, it follows from the continuity of $\varphi$ that there exists a $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $\varphi\left([c,c+\varepsilon]\right)\subset U$, which contradicts the definition of $c$. Therefore, $\varphi(c)\in A\cup V$. Then by the same argument as above, that there exists a $\varepsilon>0$ such that $\varphi([c-\varepsilon,c])\in V$ implying $\varphi(c-\varepsilon)\in V$, which contradicts the definition of $c$.
\end{proof}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
If $A$ is connected, then the closure $\text{cl}(A)$ of $A$ is also connected.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Prove by contradiction and suppose that $A$ is connected while $\text{cl}(A)$ is not closed. Then there exists open sets $U,V$ such that $\text{cl}(A)\subset U\cup V, \text{cl}(A)\cap U \neq\varnothing, \text{cl}(A)\cap V \neq\varnothing$, and $\text{cl}(A)\cup (U \cup V) = \varnothing$. Then we have 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $A\subset U\cup V$.
    \item $A\cup U \neq\varnothing$.
    \item $A\cup V \neq\varnothing$.
    \item $A\cup (U \cup V) = \varnothing$.
\end{enumerate}
which means that $A$ is disconnected. Contradiction. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, The properties $(1)$ and $(4)$ are obvious. Now we prove property $(2)$. Since $\text{cl}(A)\cap U \neq\varnothing$, then there is a $x\in \text{cl}(A)\cap U$. Hence there is a sequence $\{x_n\}\in A$ such that $$x_n\to x\in \text{cl}(A)\cap U$$
Since $U$ is open, then there exists sufficiently large $N > 0$ such that $\forall n>N$, $x_n\in A\cap U$, which proves that $A\cap U\neq\varnothing$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
The graph of the function $y = \sin \frac{1}{x}, 0\leq x\leq \pi$, i.e., the set  $$G = \left\{(x, \sin \frac{1}{x})|\, 0< x\leq \pi\right\}$$
is path connected, hence $G$ is connected.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, Therefore, $\text{cl}(G)$ is connected. However, $\text{cl}(G)$ is the union of $G$ and the segment $[-1,1]$ on the $y-$axis. It is clear that this set is not path connected. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, $\text{cl}(G)$ is an example of a set which is connected but not path connected. The plot of $y = \sin \frac{1}{x}, 0\leq x\leq \pi$ is shown as below:
\begin{figure}[h]

\newpage
\begin{theorem}[Theorem 2.47 in Rudin's book]
A subset $E$ of the real line $\mathbb{R}^1$ is connected if and only if it has the following property: If $x\in E, y\in E$ and $x<z<y$, then $z\in E$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
($\Rightarrow$) Prove by contradiction and suppose that if there exists a $z\in (x,y)$ and $z\in E$, then $E = U\cup V$, where 
\begin{align*}
    U = E\cap (-\infty,z), V = E\cap(x,\infty)
\end{align*}
Since $x\in U, y\in V$, $U$ and $V$ are not nonempty. Since $U\subset (-\infty, z)$ and $V\subset (z,\infty)$, then they are separated. Also, we can have $E\cap(U\cap V) = \varnothing$, which means $E$ is not connected. This is a contradiction.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, ($\Leftarrow$) Supposed that $E$ is not connected. Then there exist sets $U$ and $V$ separating $E$ such that $E\subset U\cup V, E\cap U\neq\varnothing, E\cap V\neq\varnothing$ and $E\cap(U\cap V) = \varnothing$. Now we pick $x\in U$ and $y\in V$ and without losing generality, assume that $x < y$. Define 
\begin{align*}
    z = \sup\{(U\setminus V)\cap[x,y]\}
\end{align*}
Then $z\in \text{cl}(U)$ and $z\notin V$. In particular, $x\leq z < y$. If $z\notin U\setminus V$, then $z$ certainly does not belong to $E$. If $z\in U\setminus V$, then $z\notin \text{cl}(V)$, hence there exists a $z_1$ such that $z<z_1<y$ and $z_1\notin V$. Then $x<z_1<y$ and $z\notin E$. This is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Continuity}
\begin{definition}
Let $(X,d), (Y,\rho)$ be two metric spaces and $A\subset X$. Consider a mapping $f:A\to Y$. If $x_0$ is an accumulation point of $A$, then we say that $\lim_{x\to x_0}f(x) = b \in Y$, if 
\begin{align*}
    \forall\varepsilon>0, \exists\delta>0, 0<d(x,x_0)<\delta \Rightarrow \rho(f(x),b)<\varepsilon
\end{align*}
Equivalently, $\lim_{x\to x_0}f(x) = b$, if
\begin{align*}
    x_0 \neq x_n (x_n\in A) \to x_0 \Rightarrow f(x_n) \to b
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
We say that a mapping $f:A\to Y$ is continuous at point $x_0\in A$, if $A\ni x_n\to x_0$ then $f(x_n)\to f(x_0)$(no need of condition: $x_n\neq x_0$). \\
\hspace*{1em}\, If $x_0$ is not an accumulation point of $A$, i.e., $x_0$ is an isolated point, then $f$ is always continuous at $x_0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
We say that $f:A\to Y$ is continuous if $f$ is continuous at every point in $A$. Equivalently, $f:A\to Y$ is continuous if for every $x\in A$ and $\forall\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that 
\begin{align*}
    d(x,y)<\delta \Rightarrow \rho(f(x),f(y))<\varepsilon.
\end{align*}
This is Definition 4.5 in Rudin's book. 
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
$ $\newline
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $X$ is a discrete metric space, then every function $f:X\to Y$ is continuous.
    \item $f:\mathbb{Z}\to Y$ or $f:\mathbb{N}\to Y$ is always continuous.
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 4.8 in Rudin's book]
A mapping $f:X\to Y$ is continuous if and only if for every open set $U\subset Y$, $f^{-1}(U)$ is an open set in $X$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $f$ is continuous and $U\subset Y$ is a open set. We want to prove that $f^{-1}(U)$ is open. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, If $x\in f^{-1}(U)$, then $f(x)\in U$ and hence $B(f(x),\varepsilon)\subset U$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$. It follows from the continuity of $f$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $d_Y(f(x),f(y))<\varepsilon$, if $d_X(x,y) < \delta$. Hence, $B(x,\delta)\subset f^{-1}(U)$ and then $f^{-1}(U)$ is open. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose now that $f^{-1}(U)$ is open for every open set $U\subset Y$. We need to prove that $f$ is continuous. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given, then $B(f(x_0),\varepsilon)$ is open. Hence $x_0\in f^{-1}(B(f(x_0),\varepsilon))$, which is open. Then there exists a $\delta>0$ such that $B(x_0,\delta)\subset f^{-1}(B(f(x_0),\varepsilon))$. And hence if $d_X(x_0,x)<\delta$, then $d_Y(f(x_0),f(x))<\varepsilon$, which proves the continuity of $f$.
\end{proof}

\medskip

\begin{definition}
We say that a mapping $f:X\to Y$ is $L-Lipschitz$ if $\forall x,y\in X$, $d_Y(f(x),f(y))\leq L d_X(x,y)$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, We say that a mapping $f:X\to Y$ is Lipschitz if it is $L-Lipschitz$ for some $L>0$.
\end{definition}

\medskip

\begin{proposition}
Every Lipschitz mapping is continuous.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $f:X\to Y$ is Lipschitz, then for $x_n\to x$, we have $$d_Y(f(x_n),f(x))\leq L d_X(x_n,x)\to 0$$ 
and hence $f(x_n)\to f(x)$.
\end{proof}
Now we use different method to prove this theorem by showing that $f^{-1}(U)$ is open for every open set $U\subset Y$.
\begin{proof}
Let $U\subset Y$ be given, and let $x\in f^{-1}(U)$. We will prove that 
\begin{align*}
    B\left(x, \frac{\varepsilon}{L}\right)\subset f^{-1}(U)
\end{align*}
where $\varepsilon$ is taken such that $B(f(x),\varepsilon)\subset U$. Now we have
\begin{align*}
    y\in B\left(x, \frac{\varepsilon}{L}\right) \Rightarrow d_X(x,y) < \frac{\varepsilon}{L}
\end{align*}
with $f$ being Lipschitz mapping, we have 
\begin{align*}
    d_Y(f(x),f(y))\leq L d_X(x,y) \leq \varepsilon
\end{align*}
then $f(y)\in B(f(x),\varepsilon)\subset U$. Then $B\left(x, \frac{\varepsilon}{L}\right)\in f^{-1}(U)$.
\end{proof}

\medskip

\begin{example}[Riemann function]
$f$ is defined as below
\begin{align*}
    f(x) = \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
    & 0, \text{if} \quad x \in \mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}\\
    & \frac{1}{q}, \text{if} \quad x \in \mathbb{Q}, x = \frac{p}{q}, q > 0
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{align*}
and where the greatest common divisor of $p$ and $q$ is $1$. Then $f$ is continuous at all irrational points and discontinuous at all rational points.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
$f(x,y)$ is defined as below
\begin{align*}
    f(x) = \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
    & 0, \text{if} \quad x \in \mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q} \\
    & 1, \text{if} \quad x \in \mathbb{Q}
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{align*}
and $f$ is discontinuous everywhere.
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
Practical way of proving continuity of a function of two(or more) variables at a given point is based on the following observation: If
\begin{align*}
    |f(x,y) - L| \leq g(x,y)\rightarrow 0
\end{align*}
where $(x,y)\to(x_0,y_0), (x,y)\neq(x_0,y_0)$, then $\lim_{(x,y)\to(x_0,y_0)}f(x,y) = L$.
\end{remark}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
If $f:X\to Y$ is continuous and $A\subset X$ is compact, then $f(A)\subset Y$ is compact.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $y_n\in f(A), n = 1,2,\cdots$ be a sequence. Then $y_n = f(x_n)$ for some $x_n\in A$. Since $A$ is compact, then there is a convergent subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ such that $x_{n_k}\to x_0\in A$. Hence, $y_{n_k} = f(x_{n_k})\to f(x_0) \in f(A)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
If $f:X\to Y$ is continuous and $A\subset X$ is connected,then $f(A)\subset Y$ is connected.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $f(A)$ is not connected. Then there exist open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $f(A)\subset U\cup V, f(A)\cap U\neq\varnothing, f(A)\cap V\neq\varnothing$ and $f(A)\cap (U\cap V)=\varnothing$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, Then we have $A\subset f^{-1}(U), A\subset f^{-1}(U), A \cap f^{-1}(U)\neq\varnothing, A \cap f^{-1}(V)\neq\varnothing$ and $A\cap (f^{-1}(U)\cap f^{-1}(V))=\varnothing$, which implies that $A$ is disconnected. This is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
If $f:X\to Y$ is continuous and $A\subset X$ is path connected,then $f(A)\subset Y$ is also path connected.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $y_1, y_2\in f(A)$. Then $y_1 = f(x_1), y_2 = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2\in A$. Since $A$ is connected, then there exists a continuous mapping $\varphi:[a,b]\to A$, such that $\varphi(a) = x_1$ and $\varphi(b) = x_2$. Then we have $\psi = f\circ \varphi: [a,b]\to f(A)$ and $\psi(a) = y_1$, $\psi(b) = y_2$, this is continuous path connecting $y_1$ and $y_2$ in $f(A)$. Thus, $f(A)$ is path connected.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
If $f:A\to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, where $A\subset X$ is compact, then $f$ attains maximum and minimum in $A$, i.e.,
\begin{align*}
    \exists x_1\in A, \forall x\in A, f(x_1)\geq f(x) \\
    \exists x_2\in A, \forall x\in A, f(x_2)\leq f(x)
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
There is a sequence $\{x_n\}\in A$ such that $f(x_n)\to \sup\{f(x)|x\in A\}$. Since $A$ is compact, then there exists a subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ of $x_n$ such that $x_{n_k}\to x_1$. Then we have $f(x_1) = \sup\{f(x)|x\in A\}$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, Similar argument works with minimum.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
If $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then $f$ is bounded.
\end{corollary}

\medskip

\begin{example}
Consider $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}, x\in (0,1]$ is continuous but unbounded on its domain, since $(a,b]$ is not closed, so the corollary does not apply.
\end{example}

\medskip

Now we classify all connected subsets. 

\begin{lemma}\label{inter_value_connected}
If $A\subset X$ is connected, and $a<c<b, a,b\in A$, then $c\in A$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By contradiction and suppose $c\notin A$. Then we can know that $A\subset (-\infty,c)\cup(c,\infty), A\cap (-\infty,c)\neq\varnothing, A\cap (c,\infty)\neq\varnothing$ and $A\cap((-\infty,c)\cap(c,\infty)) = \varnothing$. Thus, $A$ is disconnected, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
$A\subset \mathbb{R}$ is connected if and only if $A$ is an interval.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
($\Leftarrow$) Any interval is connected since it is path connected. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, ($\Rightarrow$) Let $a = \inf\{x|x\in A\}$ and $b = \sup\{x|x\in A\}$. Then there exist sequence $\{a_n\}\in A$ and $\{b_n\}\in A$ such that $a_n\to a$ and $b_b\to b$. It follows from Lemma \ref{inter_value_connected} that $[a_n, b_n]\subset A$. Hence $(a,b) = \bigcup^\infty_{n=1}[a_n,b_n]\subset A$. With the definition of $a$ and $b$ that no number less than $a$ belongs to $A$ and no number bigger than $b$ belongs to $A$. Thus, $A$ is an interval with endpoints $a$ and $b$,
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Intermediate Value Theorem]
If $f:A\to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, $A\subset X$ is connected and $f(x) = a < c < b = f(y)$, then there exists a $z\in A$ such that $f(z) = c$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Since $f$ is continuous, then $f(A)$ is an interval that contains $a$ and $b$, so it must contains $c$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Let $f:A\to \mathbb{R}^n$, $f(x) = (f_1(x), f_2(x), \cdots, f_n(x))$. Then $f$ is continuous if and only if the functions $f_i$ are continuous for $i = 1,2,\cdots, n$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
If $x_k\to x_0$, then $(f_1(x_k), f_2(x_k), \cdots, f_n(x_k))\to (f_1(x_0), f_2(x_0), \cdots, f_n(x_0))$ if $f_i(x_k)\to f_i(x_0)$.
\end{proof}

\medskip

Now we show a new method to prove the Arithmetic-Geometric mean inequality.

\begin{theorem}[Arithmetic-Geometric mean inequality]
Let $x_1,\cdots,x_n\geq 0$, then 
\begin{align*}
    \sqrt[n]{x_1 \cdots x_n}\leq \frac{x_1+\cdots+x_n}{n}
\end{align*}
and the equality holds if and only if $x_1=\cdots=x_n$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $x_1+\cdots+x_n = a$. We assume that $a > 0$ or otherwise the inequality is obvious. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, Consider the set $A = \{(z_1,\cdots,z_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n|z_1+\cdots+z_n = a, z_1,\cdots,z_n\geq 0\}$. The set is bounded and closed, and therefore compact. Hence the function $f(z_1,\cdots,z_n) = \sqrt[n]{z_1,\cdots,z_n}$ has maximum in $A$ at some point $(z_1^0,\cdots,z_n^0)\in A$. We will prove that $z_1^0=\cdots=z_n^0$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, Observe first that $z_1^0,\cdots,z_n^0 \geq 0$ because $0$ cannot be maximum of $f$. Suppose that $z_i^0\neq z_j^0$ for some $i\neq j$, then 
\begin{align*}
    \left(\frac{z_i^0 + z_j^0}{2}\right)^2 > z_i^0 z_j^0
\end{align*}
and therefore
\begin{align*}
    \sqrt[n]{z_1^0\cdots\left(\frac{z_i^0 + z_j^0}{2}\right) \cdots \left(\frac{z_i^0 + z_j^0}{2}\right)\cdots  z_n^0} > \sqrt[n]{z_1^0\cdots z_j^0 \cdots z_j^0\cdots  z_n^0}
\end{align*}
and $\left( z_1^0,\cdots,\frac{z_i^0 + z_j^0}{2},\cdots,\frac{z_i^0 + z_j^0}{2},\cdots,z_n^0\right)\in A$, this is contradicted with the definition of $(z_1^0,\cdots,z_j^0,\cdots,z_j^0,\cdots,z_n^0)$. Thus $z_1^0 = \cdots = z_n^0 = \frac{a}{n}$, and we have 
\begin{align*}
    \sqrt[n]{x_1\cdots x_n} \leq \sqrt[n]{z_1^0 \cdots z_n^0} = \frac{a}{n} = \frac{x_1 + \cdots + x_n}{n}
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\medskip

\subsection{Uniform continuity}
\begin{definition}
$f:A\to Y, A\subset X$ is called uniformly continuous, if for $\forall \varepsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that for $\forall x,y\in A$, if $d_X(x,y)<\delta$, then $d_Y(f(x),f(y))<\varepsilon$. 
\end{definition}

\medskip

\begin{proposition}
If $f:(a,b)\to \mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous, where $(a,b)$ is a bounded interval, then $f$ is bounded.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
By the definition of uniformly continuity, we take $\varepsilon = 1$. Then there is a $\delta > 0$ such that if $|x-y|\leq\delta$, then $|f(x)-f(y)| < 1$. Choose $N$ such that $N\delta > \frac{b-a}{2}$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, Let $x\geq \frac{a+b}{2}$, consider a sequence $x_k = \frac{a+b}{2}+\delta k, k=0,1,2\cdots$. Then there is $n<N$ such that $x_n \leq x$ but $x_{n+1}>x$. Thus we have 
\begin{align*}
    \left|f(x) - f\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)\right| & = \left|(f(x_n)-f(x_{n_1})) + (f(x_{n_1})-f(x_{n_2})) + \cdots + (f(x_1)-f(x_{n_0}))\right| \\
    & \leq \left|f(x_n)-f(x_{n_1})\right|  + \left|f(x_{n_1})-f(x_{n_2})\right| + \cdots + \left|f(x_1)-f(x_{n_0})\right| \\
    & \leq n+1 \leq N
\end{align*}
which proves $f$ is bounded. 
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
Suppose $f:A\to \mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous, where $A\subset X$ is a bounded subset of a metric space. Dose it follow that $f$ is bounded? 
\end{exercise}

No. And we will provide a counterexample. 

\begin{proof}
If $X$ is a discrete metric space, then any function $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous. Indeed, let arbitrary $\varepsilon > 0$, then take $\delta = 1$, then if $d_X(x,y)< \delta = 1$, it follows that $x = y$ and $|f(x)-f(y)| = 0 < \varepsilon$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, Now take $X = \mathbb{Z}$ with the metric metric. Then $X$ is bounded and and $f:X\to \mathbb{R}, f(n) = n$. Then $f$ is uniformly continuous, but not bounded.
\end{proof}

\medskip

\begin{definition}
We say that a function $f:A\to Y$, where $A\subset X$ is $\alpha-$Hölder continuous, $\alpha > 0$, if $\exists c > 0$ such that
\begin{align*}
    d_Y(f(x),f(y))\leq c d_X(x,y)^\alpha
\end{align*}
for all $x,y\in A$.
\end{definition}

\medskip

\begin{theorem}
If $f:A\to Y$ is continuous and $A\subset X$ is compact, then $f$ is uniformly continuous.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Prove by contradiction, and suppose $\exists\varepsilon > 0$, $\forall \delta > 0$, there exist $x,y\in A$ such that if $d_X(x,y)<\delta$, then $d_Y(f(x),f(y)) < \varepsilon$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, In particular, there exist sequences $\{x_n\}, \{y_n\}\in A$ such that $d_X(x_n,y_n) < \frac{1}{n}$ and $d_Y(f(x_n),f(y_n))\geq \varepsilon$. Since $A$ is compact, there is a subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ such that $x_{n_k}\to x_0\in A$. Since $d_X(x_{n_k},y_n) < \frac{1}{n_k}$, we also have $y_{n_k}\to x_0$. Hence, with $f$ being continuous, $f(x_{n_k})\to f(x_0)$ and $f(y_{n_k})\to f(x_0)$. Therefore, $d_Y(f(x_{n_k}),f(Y_{n_k}))\to 0$, which contradicts the inequality $d_Y(f(x_{n_k}),f(Y_{n_k})) > \varepsilon$.
\end{proof}

Recall that for $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$, the graph is defined by
\begin{align*}
    G_f = \{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^m|= \mathbb{R}^{n+m}| y = f(x)\}
\end{align*}

\begin{exercise}
Prove that if $f$ is continuous, then $G_f$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$. Is converse implication true? 
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
(1) Let $f$ be continuous. We need to prove that if $G_f\ni (x_k,y_k)\to (x_0,y_0)$, then $(x_0,y_0)\in G_f$. We have $(x_k,y_k)\in G_f$, then $y_k = f(x_k)$. Now we have $x_k\to x_0\in \mathbb{R}$, then $f(x_k)\to y_0$. Since $f$ is continuous, then $f(x_k)\to f(x_0)$. Hence $y_0 = f(x_0)$ and therefore $(x_0,y_0) = (x_0, f(x_0)) \in G_f$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, (2) The converse implication is false. For example, consider function 
\begin{align*}
    f(x) = \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
    & \frac{1}{x}, \text{if} \quad x \neq 0 \\
    & 0, \text{if} \quad x = 0
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{align*}
which is discontinuous. But its graph is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$, which is shown as below.

\end{proof}

\medskip

\begin{exercise}
Prove that if $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^m$ is bounded, then $f$ is continuous if and only if $G_f$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
($\Rightarrow$) is proved in the previous exercise.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $G_f$ is closed, then we want to prove that if $x_n\to x_0$, then $f(x_n)\to f(x_0)$. We prove it by contradiction and assume that there is a sequence $x_n\to x_0$ such that $\lim_{x_n\to x_0}f(x_n)\neq f(x_0)$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, Then there is a $\varepsilon > 0$, and for $\forall N > 0$ such that if $n > N$, i.e., $\forall n > 0$, we will have $|f(x_n) - f(x_0)|\geq \varepsilon$. Then we can find a convergent subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ such that $\forall k$, $|f(x_{n_k}) - f(x_0)|\geq \varepsilon$. The sequence $f(x_{n_k})$ is bounded in $\mathbb{R}^m$, then it has a convergent subsequence $\{f(x_{n_{k_l}})\}$ converging to $y_0$. And now we have 
\begin{align*}
    G_f \ni \left(x_{n_{k_l}},f(x_{n_{k_l}})\right) \to (x_0,y_0)
\end{align*}
and since $G_f$ is closed, then $(x_0,y_0)\in G_f$ and $y_0 = f(x_0)$. Therefore $f(x_{n_{k_l}})\to f(x_0)$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\medskip
 
Next we give some important examples and theorems about continuity and metric space.

\begin{exercise}
Let $\{f_n\}^\infty_{n=1}, f_n:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of continuous functions such that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $f_n \geq 0$.
    \item $f_{n+1}\leq f_n$.
    \item $\forall x\in [0,1], f_n(x)\to 0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
Then $f_n$ uniformly converges to $0$.
\begin{proof}
Given $\varepsilon > 0$, we need to find $N > 0$ such that if $\forall n \geq N$ and $\forall x\in [0,1]$, then $0 < f_n(x) < \varepsilon$.\\
\hspace*{1em}\, For $x\in [0,1]$, let $N_x$ be the least integer such that $f_{N_x} < \varepsilon$. Then for $\forall n \geq N_x$, $f_n(x) < \varepsilon$. Since $f_{N_x}$ is continuous function, so there exists an open neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ in $[0,1]$ such that for $z\in U_x$, we have $f_{N_x}(x) < \varepsilon$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, Since $[0,1]$ is compact, then there exists a finite open covering such that $[0,1]\in U_{x_1}\cup U_{x_2} \cup \cdots \cup U_{x_k}$. Now we pick $N = \max\{N_{x_1},N_{x_2},\cdots,N_{x_k}\}$, where $N_{x_j}$ is the least number such that $f_{N_{x_j}}(x_j) < \varepsilon$. If $n\geq N$ and for $x\in[0,1]$, then $x\in U_{x_i}$ for some $i\in\{1,2,\cdots, k\}$, which implies $0 \leq f_n(x) \leq f_N(x) \leq f_{N_i}(x) < \varepsilon$.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
Let $F:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ be a norm, i.e., for $\forall x,y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $t\in\mathbb{R}$, we have
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $F(x)\geq 0$ and $F(x) = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$.
    \item $F(x+y)\leq F(x) + F(y)$.
    \item $F(tx) = |t|F(x)$
\end{enumerate}
Then there exist $A,B > 0$ such that $A\|x\|\leq F(x)\leq B\|x\|$ for all $x\mathbb{R}$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
(1) We claim that $F$ is bounded on unit sphere $\{\|x\| = 1\}$. \\
\hspace*{1em} Let $\{e_1,e_2,\cdots,e_n\}$ be orthonormal basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$, then any $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ has a representation
\begin{align*}
    x = \sum^n_{i=1} c_ie_i
\end{align*}
If $\|x\| = 1$, then we have $|c_i| \leq 1$. And we have 
\begin{align*}
    F(x) = F\left(\sum^n_{i=1} c_ie_i\right) \leq \sum^n_{i=1} |c_i| F(e_i) \leq \sum^n_{i=1} F(e_i) = B
\end{align*}
Then there exists a $B > 0$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, (2) Now we claim $F$ is continuous. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, If $x \neq y$, then we have $y = x + \|y-x\|\cdot \frac{y-x}{\|y-x\|}$. Thus, we have
\begin{align*}
    & F(y) \leq F(x) + \|y-x\| F \left(\frac{y-x}{\|y-x\|}\right) \\
    \Rightarrow & F(y) - F(x) \leq B\|y-x\|
\end{align*}
Now we switch $x$ and $y$, then we have $F(x) - F(y) \leq B\|y-x\|$. Thus we have $|F(x) - F(y)|\leq B \|y-x\|$, which implies $F$ is continuous. \\

Now we complete the proof of theorem. Since $F$ is continuous, so it obtains its minimum $A$ on the compact unit sphere, i.e.,
\begin{align*}
    & A = \inf_{\|x\| = 1}F(x) = F(x_0) > 0 \\
    \Rightarrow & A\leq F(x) \leq B, \|x\| = 1
\end{align*}
Now if $\|x\|\neq 0$ is any point in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then 
\begin{align*}
    & F(x) = F\left(\|x\|\cdot\frac{x}{\|x\|}\right) = \|x\|\cdot F\left(\frac{x}{\|x\|}\right) \\
    \Rightarrow & A\|x\|\leq F(x)\leq B\|x\|
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
Prove that if $X$ is a metric space, and $f:X\times[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then $g:X\to\mathbb{R}$, which is defined by 
\begin{align*}
    g(x) = \sup_{t\in[0,1]}f(x,t)
\end{align*}
is continuous.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
Prove by contradiction, and suppose $g$ is not continuous, i.e., there exists $\varepsilon > 0$, for $\forall \delta > 0$, $\exists x$ such that if $d_X(x,x_0) < \delta$, then $|g(x) - g(x_0)|\geq\varepsilon$. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, Fix such $\varepsilon > 0$, we pick $\delta = \frac{1}{n}$, then exists $x_n$ such that $d_X(x_n,x_0) < \frac{1}{n}$, then $|g(x_n) - g(x_0)| \geq \varepsilon$, which implies
\begin{align*}
    \left|\sup_t f(x_n,t) - \sup_t f(x_0,t)\right| \geq \varepsilon
\end{align*}
then there exist $t_n, t_0\in[0,1]$ such that 
\begin{align*}
    \left|f(x_n,t_n) - f(x_0,t_0)\right| \geq \varepsilon
\end{align*}
where $x_n\to x_0$. Then there exists a subsequence $t_{n_k}\to s$, such that $f(x_{n_k},t_{n_k})\to f(x_0,s)$. Then we have 
\begin{align*}
    f(x_{n_k},t_{n_k}) & = \sup_t f(x_{n_k},t) \geq f(x_{n_k},t_0) \\
    f(x_0,t_0) & = \sup_t f(x_0,t) \geq f(x_0,s) 
\end{align*}
Thus, we have 
\begin{align*}
    f(x_0,t_0) \leftarrow f(x_{n_k},t_0) \leq f(x_{n_k},t_{n_k}) \rightarrow f(x_0,s) \leq f(x_0,t_0)
\end{align*}
which means $f(x_{n_k},t_{n_k})\to f(x_0,t_0)$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
If $A\subset U$ is a dense subset of a metric space, i.e., $\text{cl}(A) = X$, and $f:A\to\mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous, then there is a unique continuous function $F:X\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $F(x) = f(x)$ for all $x\in A$. Moreover, $F$ is uniformly continuous.
\end{theorem}

Before we prove the theorem, we first introduce an exercise, then we provide the proof of theorem.

\begin{exercise}
If $f:(a,b)\to\mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous, and $-\infty < a < b < \infty$, then $f$ extends to a continuous function $F:[a,b)\to\mathbb{R}$. In particular, $F$ is bounded.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
For $x\in X$, we choose a unique $A\ni a_k^x\to x$. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, then $\forall\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$, and for $\forall x,y\in A$, if $d_X(x,y) < \delta$, then $|f(x) - f(y)| < \varepsilon$. For such $\delta > 0$, there exists a $N > 0$ such that $\forall k,l$, then $d_X(a_k^x, a_l^x) < \delta$, and hence $$|f(a_k^x) - f(a_l^x)| < \varepsilon$$
then we can know that $\{f(a_k^x)\}^\infty_{k=1}$ is a Cauchy sequence. Thus it is convergent. \\
\hspace*{1em}\, We now define $$F(x) = \lim_{k\to\infty}f(a_k^x)$$
If $d_x(x,y) < \delta$, then $d_X(a_k^x,a_k^y) < \delta$. Then for some $K > 0$, if $\forall k \geq K$, then $$|f(a_k^x) - f(a_k^y)| < \varepsilon \Rightarrow |F(x) - F(y)| < \varepsilon$$
Thus, $F$ is uniformly continuous.
\end{proof}
